# Welcome to the Rosa Anime Character Repository!
_Project status: Finished_

This project is documentation of project to create *Rosa*, a 3D modeled anime character. üé®‚ú® Rosa was created by following along [Grant Abbit's - Anime Character Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckpKgQjfyc) and given my own twist. Here, you'll find everything related to this project‚Äîfrom progress updates to resources and the final render!

### Project Goals

- **Character modeling**: In stead of sculpting, I wanted to learn how to model a character from scratch. Learning about topology, edge flow, poles, as well as how to UV-unwrap and texture paint the model.
- **Creating a scene**: In stead of just posing the model, I wanted to create a scene that tells a story.


### Learning Goals

As part of this project, I'm using Rosa as a way to deepen my skills in various aspects of 3D character creation, specifically focusing on the following areas:

1. **Improving Modeling in Blender**: Focusing on face count, topology, edge flow and how and when to create poles.
2. **Understanding Workflow**: 
   - **Topology / Retopology**: Learning how to create clean topology.
   - **Clothing/Armor Creation**: Gaining skills in modeling clothing and armor, focusing clean topology.
   - **UV Unwrapping**: Learning the best practices for unwrapping complex models in preparation for texturing.
   - **Texture Painting**: Developing skills in texture painting for creating materials like skin, armor, and hair.
   - **Rigging with Weight Painting**: Exploring rigging and how weight painting influences the deformations in character animation.
   - **Posing**: Learning how to pose the character for animations and visual storytelling.

### Side Quest

This project, was a "side quest" to explore character creation in more depth while working on **Darius the male hero** sculpt. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of topology, and rigging, and I'm applying the lessons learned back into the creation of Darius.

You can check out the [Darius project here](https://github.com/ux-fran/darius-male-hero-sculpt-repo).

### Process Overview

- **Character Modeling**: During the creation of Darius, I got curious about how to go about topology of a character. Before I would go further with sculpting Darius I wanted to learn about creating topology myself.
- **Rigging**: I played around with rigging with my first sculpt (Emilia) and the characters of the Bax Game Design, but I wanted to learn more about it. This topic is also covered by Grant in his course. 
- **Next Steps**: After this model, I'm went back to the Darius sculpt. Trying to encorporate the things I learned into the sculpt.
