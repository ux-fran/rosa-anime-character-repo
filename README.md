# Welcome to the Rosa Anime Character Repository! 🎨✨

🔙 _Back to my Blender projects main hub_: [Fran's Blender Projects Hub](https://github.com/ux-fran/blender-projects-main-hub-repo)

_Project Status_: **Finished** 🎉  
_Repository_: **[Rosa Anime Character Repository](https://github.com/ux-fran/rosa-anime-character-repo)**  
_Project Progress_: **[Rosa Progress](https://github.com/users/ux-fran/projects/68)**  

This repository documents the creation of **Rosa**, a 3D modeled anime character inspired by [Grant Abbitt's Anime Character Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckpKgQjfyc). Rosa was given my own creative twist, focusing on character modeling, topology, UV unwrapping, and texturing. Here, you'll find everything related to this project—from progress updates to resources and the final render!

## 🧩 Project Overview

- **Goal**: To model a complete anime-style character with clean topology and create a scene that tells a story.
- **Art Style**: Stylized anime character with a focus on expressive features and storytelling.
- **Tools Used**: Blender for modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, and posing.

## 📚 Learning Goals

This project provided a valuable opportunity to explore key aspects of character creation, including:

1. **Modeling**: Creating a character from scratch with clean topology, focusing on edge flow and poles.
2. **UV Unwrapping**: Learning best practices for unwrapping complex models to prepare for texturing.
3. **Texture Painting**: Developing skills in painting materials like skin, hair, and clothing.
4. **Rigging and Weight Painting**: Exploring how to rig characters and use weight painting to achieve natural deformations.
5. **Posing and Storytelling**: Learning how to pose the character and create a visually appealing scene with narrative depth.

## 🎮 Side Quest: The Rosa Project

The **Rosa Project** was a side quest I took on during my work on the **Darius Sculpt**. While sculpting Darius, I realized I needed to improve my understanding of **topology** and **rigging**, so I paused to complete this project. The lessons learned from modeling Rosa directly impacted my work on Darius.

Curious about Darius? Check out the project here: [Darius Male Hero Sculpt](https://github.com/ux-fran/darius-male-hero-sculpt-repo).
